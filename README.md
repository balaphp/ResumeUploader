# ResumeUploader
 ResumeUploader This repo consists of a basic HTML form that collects user data and resumes. The data is stored in MongoDB. The resume is stored in the local PC. I've used NodeJS, Express as backend to connect the HTML page to the database.  The node_modules folder contains all the external libraries and dependencies used for the project.  The main.js file is the main javascript code that is used to render the HTML, CSS to the browser. Express is used and the form is hosted in localhost port 8000.  The views folder contains HTML, CSS and the images used for this mini-project.
